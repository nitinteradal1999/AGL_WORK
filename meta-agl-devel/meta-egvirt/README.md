Virtualization support (meta-egvirt)
======================================================

meta-egvirt is the AGL Virtualization Expert Group (EG-VIRT) layer. It aims to
design, test, implement and assess virtualization technologies (containers,
hypervisors, system partitioners and other solutions) for AGL ARMv8 and Intel
platforms.

From the software side, VirtIO standards are considered as a common framework to
provide virtualized devices. Developing standardized solutions reduces community
fragmentation and increases freedom to choose hypervisor and SoC.

From the hardware side, the primary target of such work is for the time being
the Reference Hardware development platform which uses the Renesas R-Car H3 SoC
(ARMv8). Other solutions will be added in future, depending on their
availability and on the community interest.
