## Unified HMI support layer (meta-uhmi)
"Unified HMI" is a common platform technology for UX innovation in integrated cockpit by flexible information display on multiple displays of various applications. Applications can be rendered to any display via a unified virtual display.

## Remote Virtio GPU Device support layer(meta-rvgpu)
The RVGPU rendering engine, operating on a client-server model, creates 3D rendering commands on a client device and transmits them to a server device via the network, where the server-side device performs GPU-based rendering and displays the results. For build instructions and testing methods, Refer to the README.md file in the meta-rvgpu directory.
RVGPU is OSS. For more details, visit the following URL:
